## Welcome Friends! 

We are building **NeuroCausal**, an open source platform for the storage, sharing, synthesis and meta-analysis of neuropsychological data.


#### Mission statement

We are working with clinicians, neuroimagers, and software developers to develop an open source platform for the storage, sharing, synthesis and meta-analysis of human clinical data to the service of the clinical and cognitive neuroscience community so that the future of neuropsychology can be transdiagnostic, open, and FAIR.
