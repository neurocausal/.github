Welcome! We are building NeuroCausal, an open source platform for the storage, sharing, synthesis and meta-analysis of neuropsychological data.


### Mission Statement

We are working with clinicians, neuroimagers, and software developers to develop an open source platform for the storage, sharing, synthesis and meta-analysis of human clinical data to the service of the clinical and cognitive neuroscience community so that the future of neuropsychology can be transdiagnostic, open, and FAIR.
